# Development

This document describes the usual development loop for hacking on this project.

## Prerequisites

- Read [Contributing page](./CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Set up a Kubernetes cluster

- [Using KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)](#create-a-kind-cluster-optional)
- Using a different Kubernetes cluster: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/

### Create a KinD cluster (Optional)

_Note: If you're not using `KinD`, you can skip this step._

```shell
kind create cluster
```

Alternatively you can use [./hack/create-kind-cluster.sh](hack/create-kind-cluster.sh) to setup a kind cluster with a
local registry. This local registry will then be available by default at `localhost:5001`.

```shell
./hack/create-kind-cluster.sh
```

## Installation

This guide assumes you have a Kubernetes cluster up and running and reachable via `kubectl`.

### Before you begin

### Container registry

We use a container registry to publish container images, so we need to point the environment variable `KO_DOCKER_REPO`
to your own registry.

For example, to use Docker Hub, we can run the following command:

```shell
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=docker.io/<username>
```

_Note: replace `<username>` with your username._

In case you setup `KinD` via [./hack/create-kind-cluster.sh](hack/create-kind-cluster.sh), the local registry is
available at `localhost:5001`:

```shell
export KO_DOCKER_REPO=localhost:5001
```

### Install dependencies (Eventing and Kafka) and publish test images

```shell
./hack/run.sh deploy-infra
```

### Install Eventing Kafka Broker

```shell
./hack/run.sh deploy
```

> **Note:** If you want to deploy the broker with Loom Virtual Thread implementation, use`./hack/run.sh deploy-loom` [For more details](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-kafka-broker/blob/main/docs/broker/Loom-Modules.md)

### Run build tests

```shell
./hack/run.sh build-tests
```

_Note: These tests do not require a running Kubernetes cluster._

### Run unit tests

```shell
./hack/run.sh unit-tests
```

If you want to run only data plane unit tests run the following command:

```shell
./hack/run.sh unit-tests-data-plane
```

Or, alternatively, if you want to run only control plane unit tests run the following command:

```shell
./hack/run.sh unit-tests-control-plane
```

_Note: These tests do not require a running Kubernetes cluster._

### Run integration and E2E tests

_Note: This test requires at least 5Gi of memory_

```shell
LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT=true SKIP_INITIALIZE=true ./test/e2e-tests.sh
```

### Run a single rekt test

You can run a single rekt test instead of the full test suite with:

```shell
SYSTEM_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 -run <test_name> -parallel=12 -timeout=30m <test_directory_name>
```

Note: you will have to replace the <test_name>  <test_directory_name> with the name of your test.

For example:

```shell
SYSTEM_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 -run TestEventTransformationForTrigger -parallel=12 -timeout=30m ./test/e2e_new
```

When you are running kafka broker related tests, you may need to specify the broker class

```shell
 SYSTEM_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing BROKER_CLASS=Kafka go test -v -tags=e2e -count=1 -run TestBrokerTLSCARotation  -parallel=12 -timeout=30m ./test/e2e_new
```

Below are descriptions of the parameters you will normally use, as well as some other things you will often need to set while running the tests:

```shell
-v prints verbose output from the tests
-tags=e2e uses files tagged as e2e when building the tests
-count=1 runs each test once rather than potentially multiple times
-run <test_name> specifies the name of the single test to run
-parallel=12 runs tests in parallel up to 12 at a time
-timeout=30m sets the timeout for each test to 30 minutes
./test/rekt specifies the directory containing the rekt tests
SYSTEM_NAMESPACE=knative-eventing sets the namespace to use for the tests
BROKER_CLASS=Kafka specifies to use the Kafka broker implementation for broker related tests
```

### Hack, build, test and iterate

Once we have everything up and running we can start writing code, building, testing and iterating again and again.

We can run the following command to apply newly added changes to our Kubernetes cluster:

```shell
./hack/run.sh deploy
```

### Run Sacura test

Sacura is a tool designed to continuously send and receive CloudEvents at a configurable pace.

We use it to test that our components don't lose events for a given period of time.

_Note: This test requires at least 4Gi of memory_

```shell
./hack/run.sh deploy-sacura
./hack/run.sh sacura-test
```

Once the test completes, run the following command to clean up sacura resources:

```shell
./hack/run.sh teardown-sacura
```

### Run Chaos test

Our integration tests run while a continuous pod killer, called `chaosduck`, is running to detect high availability
issues.

_Note: `chaosduck` is heavyweight since it requires that every component has multiple replicas._

```shell
./hack/run.sh deploy-chaos
```

`chaosduck` itself does nothing other than killing leader pods, so at this point you should run our E2E tests.

Once you want to stop `chaosduck`, run the following command:

```shell
./hack/run.sh teardown-chaos
```

### Run profiler

We run `async-profiler` in CI to allow a reviewer to check that newly added changes of a PR are reasonable in terms of
resource usages.

The profiler can measure some events like `alloc`, `cpu`, etc, and we need to specify which event we want to measure.

_Note: this command requires root privileges, and it can only run on Linux._

```shell
export EVENT=alloc
./hack/run.sh profiler
```

For more information on the profiler test, see [the profiler test doc](./data-plane/profiler/README.md).

### Run Filter Benchmarks

If you are building a fitler benchmark or want to benchmark the performance delta caused when changing the filters, you can run:

```shell
./hack/run.sh benchmark-filter <filter_class_name>
```

This will run the benchmarks for the class with `<filter_class_name>`. A full list of all available classes can be seen [here](https://github.com/knative-extensions/eventing-kafka-broker/blob/main/data-plane/benchmarks/resources/filter-class-list.txt).
For example, if you want to run all of the Exact Filter Benchmarks, you could run:

```shell
./hack/run.sh benchmark-filter ExactFilterBenchmark
```

Similarly, to run benchmarks for any filter, you can run:

```shell
./hack/run.sh benchmark-filter AnyFilterBenchmark
```

Alternatively, if you want to run all of the benchmarks you can run:

```shell
./hack/run.sh benchmark-filters
```

## Code generation

Sometimes, before deploying the services it's required to run our code generators, by running the following command:

```shell
./hack/run.sh generate
```

This step is required only if we're changing a protobuf definition file, or for some specific API changes.

If you're unsure, whether you need to run it or not for your changes, run [our build tests](#run-build-tests).

## Code Formatting

### Go

We are using [go fmt](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt) to format our Go code. To format your code, run the following
command within the `control-plane` directory:

```shell
go fmt ./...
```

### Java

We are using Spotless to format our Java code. To format your code, run the following command within the `data-plane`
directory:

```shell
./mvnw spotless:apply
```

You can also configure it to your IDE. For more information, please refer
to [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).

This action is also performed **automatically** when you run `./hack/run.sh generate`.
