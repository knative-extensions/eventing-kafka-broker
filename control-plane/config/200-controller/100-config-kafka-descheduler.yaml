    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # These predicate plugins are used to filter out pods that
    # a vreplica cannot be removed from due to not satisfying the
    # predicate condition. For each pod, the descheduler
    # will call filter plugins in their configured order.
    # predicates: |+
                    []
    #
    # These priority plugins are used to score each pod that
    # has passed the filtering phase. The scheduler will then
    # select the pod with the highest weighted score sum to
    # remove vreplica from. If two pods have an equal score,
    # a pod is chosen randomly.
